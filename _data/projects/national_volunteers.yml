title: COVID-19 National Scientist Volunteer Database

description: |
    This project sets up a database of scientists in the United States 
    who are eager to volunteer their time, expertise, and resources to help
    fight COVID-19. Scientist volunteers range across disciplines, such as
    bioinformatics and data management. Individuals can add themselves to the
    database and are asked to answer several questions about themselves to
    help identify where they or their resources might be useful. Efforts that 
    need volunteers or resources can request access to the database in order 
    to help their fight against COVID-19. This allows organizations to find
    the right volunteers within their local area.

needs: |
    A wide range of skill sets could be needed, as the database can be made available
    to different projects as the need arises. Although the questions focus primarily on
    biological skill sets such as qPCR experience, skill sets of all types may be needed
    and other skill sets can be listed.
